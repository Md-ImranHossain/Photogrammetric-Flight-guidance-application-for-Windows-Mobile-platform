# Photogrammetric-Flight-guidance-application-for-Windows-Mobile-platform
In the department of Geomatics, Computer Science and Mathematics, Stuttgart University of Applied Sciences, an experimental investigation of aerial imaging using Gyrocopter was done in research lead by Prof. Dr. Michael Hahn in 2010. The main idea of the research was to investigate low cost instruments (camera and GPS receiver) mounted on a low cost platform. Even though the aerial photograph was carried out with Gyrocopter, an automated flight navigation tool was not available back then.  I have developed this application to direct the pilot along the proposed photogrammetric flight lines with visual graphics. This application has mainly three features. 
1.	Planning of photogrammetric flight lines
2.	visualize the position tracks by getting the real time position (latitude, longitude and altitude) data and rotations (omega, phi and kappa) data from the Xsens MTi-G device through serial port 
3.	Finally calculate the horizontal and vertical shift from the planned flight line and show the shifts as well as the rotations in a graphical user interface.
