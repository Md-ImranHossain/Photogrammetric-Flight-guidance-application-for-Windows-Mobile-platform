# Photogrammetric-Flight-guidance-application-for-Windows-Mobile-platform
In the department of Geomatics, Computer Science and Mathematics, Stuttgart University of Applied Sciences, an experimental investigation of aerial imaging using Gyrocopter was done in research lead by Prof. Dr. Michael Hahn. The main idea of the research was to investigate low cost instruments (camera and GPS receiver) mounted on a low cost platform. Even though the aerial photograph was carried out with Gyrocopter, an automated flight navigation tool was not still available.  This application was developed to direct the pilot along the poroposed photogrammetric flight lines with visual graphics. This application get the real time position (latitude, longitude and altitude) data and rotation (omega, phi and kappa) data from the Xsens MTi-G device through serial port, calculate the horizontal and vertical shift from the planned flight line and finally show the shifts as well as the rotations in a graphical user interface.
